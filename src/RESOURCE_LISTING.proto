// BRAINSTORMING FOR PROTO/DATA DEFINITIONS

// EVENTUALLY, EACH ENTRY WILL BE IN JSON FORMAT

// EACH JSON OBJECT WILL INCLUDE: 

/* 

- NAME OF RESOURCES (ie, "Free Code Camp")
- WEBSITE (can do regex testing around this, maybe? when the info comes in?)
- description (TEXT)
- possibly a rating system, for people to vote on their favorites, or to "save" their favorites (maybe they can save & dl them as a file or something???)
- tags for difficulty levels (one of an array, so, ENUM)
  - would be like, "beginner, expert, etc."
  - choose AT LEAST ONE from an array (EMUN)
- tags for languages (python, js, etc. we accept all languages)
  - choose AT LEAST ONE from an array (EMUN)



- date updated (note - when the entry is first submitted, this will also just be the date of submission)

*/

/* -------- proto message in plain english (TODO: convert to proto syntax) -------------- 

proto name: (?) 

title - TEXT, possibly w/character limit
description - TEXT, also char limit OPTIONAL

url - text, with format validation (can be done client-side via regex during the user form entry process)
date - automatically generated: the date submitted (TODO: WHAT IS THE DATA TYPE OF "DATE" IN PROTO?)





LATER/TODO: think about adding some element of user ratings/review
